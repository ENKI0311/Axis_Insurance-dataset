# Axis Insurance Dataset Project

## Overview
The **Axis Insurance Dataset Project** is an initiative to explore, analyze, and innovate in the insurance industry. Using real-world data, this project aims to uncover actionable insights, develop predictive models, and craft impactful visualizations to drive innovation in insurance analytics.

---

## Workflow and Methodology

### 1. **Data Exploration**
- Comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover:
  - Trends in policy types, claims, and customer demographics.
  - Key metrics like claim amounts, policyholder lifetime value, and risk factors.
- Visualized data distributions, correlations, and outliers for better understanding.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset:
  - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
  - Applied feature engineering to create new variables like **Claim-to-Premium Ratio** and **Policy Tenure**.
  - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like **one-hot encoding**.
- Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

### 3. **Model Development**
- Developed and evaluated predictive models for tasks such as:
  - **Claim Prediction**: Identified customers likely to make claims.
  - **Fraud Detection**: Flagged potential fraudulent claims.
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers based on risk profiles and value.
- Models used include:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **K-Means Clustering** for segmentation.

### 4. **Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using:
  - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** for classification tasks.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score** for regression tasks.
- Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of predictions.

## Results and Insights
- Identified high-risk customer segments with tailored recommendations for risk mitigation.
- Predicted claims with an **accuracy of 85%** and flagged fraudulent claims with a **precision of 92%**.
- Generated insights into policyholder behavior, influencing customer retention strategies.
